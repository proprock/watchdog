# Foundation verification

2026-09-05, Windows, isolated CPython 3.12.13 via uv 0.11.7. For sandbox runs, `UV_CACHE_DIR` and `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` point to the ignored project `.cache` directory; this is an environment workaround, not a product requirement.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| TDD red: pytest before package creation | Both tests failed because agent_watchdog was missing |
| `uv run pytest -q` | 2 passed; cache warning due to sandbox permissions |
| `uv run pytest -q -o cache_dir=.cache/pytest` | 2 passed, no warnings |
| `uv sync --locked` | PASS |
| `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| `uv build` | Wheel and sdist built |
| `uv run agent-watchdog --help` | PASS; explicitly states that collection is not implemented |
| `uv run --isolated --no-project --python 3.12 --managed-python --with ./dist/agent_watchdog-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl agent-watchdog --help` | PASS; built wheel installed in an isolated environment and its console entry point executed |
| `git diff --check` | PASS for the tracked diff |

The new text files were also checked for local Markdown links, trailing whitespace, and UTF-8/LF: 17 files, PASS. This was a documentation check, not a product test suite.

At M0 acceptance, the CI matrix was configured but remote CI, macOS/Linux, and live vendor hooks had not been tested. Fixtures or documentation alone do not establish runtime support. Subsequent live results are in [the WD-002 report](provider-compatibility.md). Completed task records live in [DONE.md](../DONE.md).

## M0 acceptance audit

The local checks above were rerun after the English documentation update: 2 tests passed without warnings, locked dependency synchronization and Ruff passed, and wheel/sdist builds succeeded. The isolated wheel check verifies the distribution rather than relying solely on the editable development installation.

Reviewed the CI matrix and read-only permissions, source links and explicit integration limitations, task dependencies and acceptance criteria, and the separation of open and completed work. All M0 deliverables are present. Windows live provider evidence remains M1 work; macOS/Linux host access and compatibility validation are deferred to M5 / WD-019; no remote CI run or runtime collection is claimed.

## WD-002 capture probe

2026-09-05: the five new capture test cases first failed because the script did not exist, then passed after implementation. Full suite: 8 passed; Ruff lint and formatting passed. Tests cover malformed input, structural capture without content, identity correlation, and fail-open storage errors with a Codex no-op response. Live hooks are opt-in and never run in pytest. See [provider compatibility](provider-compatibility.md) for actual surface coverage, failed diagnostic attempts, and limitations.

## WD-003 contracts

Windows, CPython 3.12.13: initial new tests failed at collection because the config/registry modules were absent. Final verification: 42 tests passed without skips, Ruff lint/format and ty passed, `uv sync --locked` passed, wheel/sdist built, and the contracts imported from an isolated wheel installation. Tests exercised real temporary Git repositories, a linked worktree and clone, symlink/case aliases, explicit relocation, project overrides, protected invalid configs, atomic-save failure, and nullable event identifiers. The existing detach probe exposed a Windows working-directory cleanup race during the full run; WD-023 fixed it and the full suite passed afterward. No live provider probes or remote CI runs were performed. Concurrent configuration writers are not implemented; callers must serialize mutations until the daemon/CLI workflow provides coordination.
